\section{Spring 2025}

This is a short-form update to the full Ecosystem and Socioeconomic Profile [@tabandera_black_2024] highlighting the recent status of environmental, ecological, and socioeconomic factors. Black sea bass is an important Mid-Atlantic stock with high commercial value and recreational engagement. Overfishing is not occurring and the stock is not overfished. Winter bottom temperature is used in the stock assessment model as a factor that influences recruitment  to incorporate the observed link between cold temperature and smaller year classes [@nefsc_report_2023].

\section{2024 in Review}
\vspace{-0.25cm}

\subsection{Fishing Community Observations}

-   Steady or increasing availability 
-   Concerns about high discards
-   Restrictive and complex regulations limit fishing opportunities
-   For additional information, see @mafmc_black_2024, @mafmc_summer_2024, and @mafmc_summer_2024b

\vspace{-0.25cm}
\subsection{Commercial Fishery}

-   Number of active vessels declined in 2024, but total landed pounds increased from 2023 
-   Total revenue decreased slightly along with average prices (\$/lb)
-   Average revenue per vessel increased

\vspace{-0.25cm}
\subsection{Recreational Fishery}

-   Targeted trips, catch, and landings all down from 2023 [@mafmc_black_2024]
-   However, number of trips is still above the historic average
-   Recreational catch-per-angler index not yet updated for 2024

\vspace{-0.25cm}
\subsection{Ecosystem}

-   The stock assessment models the stock as two subunits, divided at the Hudson Canyon (see right)
-   Cold winter in the north but near average in the south
-   Poor or below average fish condition (i.e., weight at a given length; see below)

\raggedright

<!-- maybe this is being centered because it's the only section without a header? -->
\subsection{Moderate-high to high risk of the stock not achieving optimal biomass due to:}

-   Very high exposure to changes in climate
-   Observed and potential changes in distribution; northward shift into the Gulf of Maine
-   Dependence on threatened estuarine habitat
-   Decline in the biomass of benthic invertebrate prey
-   Decline in black sea bass body condition (see right)

\vspace{-0.25cm}
\subsection{High risk of the recreational fishery not achieving optimal yield due to:}

-   Catch exceeding harvest limits in several years
-   High regulatory complexity; frequent changes and varying interstate regulations; regulatory changes in allocations

\vspace{-0.25cm}
\subsection{Moderate-high risk of the commercial fishery not achieving optimal yield due to:}

-   Commercial revenue in wind development areas
-   High discards & discard mortality

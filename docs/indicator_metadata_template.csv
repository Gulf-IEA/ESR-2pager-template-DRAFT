BSB_Winter_Bottom_Temperature_North,"Winter (Feb-Mar) bottom temperature in the black sea bass North and South stock regions combined. Hubert's data product is a composite before 1993, and from 1993-2019 it is the same as GLORYS. 2020-2024 data are pulled directly from GLORYS. The GLORYS12V1 product is the CMEMS global ocean eddy-resolving (1/12? horizontal resolution, 50 vertical levels) reanalysis.","Bottom temperatures in 2024 are decreasing relative to recent years, but still within 1 sd of the mean.",Cold winter temperatures in the Northwest Atlantic (north of Hudson Canyon).,"Cold winter temperatures may increase the mortality of young-of-the-year fish, resulting in smaller year classes. Additionally, cold temperatures can cause northern fish to move into the southern subregion, leading to potential misallocation of catch between the northern and southern stock subunits. 2024 temperature in the northern subunit (north of Hudson Canyon) was colder than black sea bass's lower threshold of 8C.","du Pontavice, H., Miller, T.

BSB_Shelf_Water_Volume_South,"Shelf water volume (km^3) for the Southern stock subunit. Shelf water volume is a measure of the volume of water inshore of the shelf-slope front, a narrow transition region between masses of cool, low salinity shelf water and warm, high salinity slope water. This in-situ data was derived from CTD data from NEFSC surveys and is maintained by Paula Fratantoni.","There has been no winter sampling since 2021, no trend for 2024.","There has been no winter sampling since 2021, no trend for 2024.","Shelf water volume is a proxy for suitable winter habitat; higher shelf water volume indicates less suitable habitat, potentially leading to northern fish migrating into the southern subregion.","Fratantoni PS, Holzworth-Davis T, Taylor MH. 2015.

BSB_mrip_trips,Total annual recreational black sea bass fishing trips for both North and South subunits. Data from NOAA Fisheries’ Marine Recreational Information Program (MRIP).,"Recent trip numbers are near an all-time high, but may have decreased from 2023.",Catch generally reflects trip patterns.

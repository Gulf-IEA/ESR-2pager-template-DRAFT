Indicator (units),Status in 2024,Implications,Time Series,w,h
Mean winter (Feb-Mar) bottom temperature (°C),North: Below threshold South: Near long-term average,"Cold winter temperatures may increase the mortality of young-of-the-year fish, resulting in smaller year classes. 2024 temperature in the northern subunit (north of Hudson Canyon) was colder than black sea bass's lower threshold of 8C. Bottom temperature data comes from GLORYS, a modeled product.",bt_facet.png,3,1.5
Shelf water volume (km3),N/A (no data for 2024),"Shelf water volume is a proxy for suitable winter habitat; higher shelf water volume indicates less suitable habitat, potentially leading to northern fish migrating into the southern subregion. The shelf water volume dataset is created from in situ data, and there has been no winter sampling since 2021, highlighting the need for additional indicators to inform stock subunit mixing.",swv_facet.png,3,1.5
MRIP recreational trips (millions of annual trips),Above long-term average,"Recent trip numbers are near an all-time high, but have decreased from 2023. Catch (not shown) generally reflects trip patterns. High regulatory complexity is likely contributing to recreational fishing trends.",total_recreational_trips_n_millions_2025-04-03.png,3,1
MRIP recreational landings (millions of lbs.),Near long-term average,"The recreational black sea bass fishery has a catch-and-release component, and management measures are being implemented to reduce recreational harvest. ",total_recreational_landings_lbs_millions_2025-04-03.png,3,1
Commercial revenue per vessel (2024 USD),Above long-term average,Commercial revenue per vessel follows an overall increasing trend most likely driven by the continued decline of active vessels and an overall increase in total commercial landed pounds over the past decade.   ,AVGVESREVperYr_BLACK_SEABASS_2024_DOLlb_2025-04-17.png,3,1
Number of commercial vessels (#),Below long-term average,"The number of active vessels has been decreasing since 2017, which could impact revenue distributions and fleet composition. ",N_Commercial_Vessels_Landing_BLACK_SEABASS_2025-04-17.png,3,1
